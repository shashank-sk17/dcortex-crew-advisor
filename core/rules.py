"""The seven rules.

Each returns a `RuleVerdict` carrying the numbers, never a bare boolean — a
controller acting on "illegal" needs to know *by how much*, because "exceeds
by 1h20m" is actionable and "illegal" is not.

Rules are evaluated against a `CrewSnapshot`, which is whatever the backend
already knows about one crew member. Keeping the rules pure functions of a
snapshot means they are testable without a database and identical whichever
port supplies the data.
