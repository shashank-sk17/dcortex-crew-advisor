"""The callout notification — Q36.

Drafting the message to the crew member is the one job in this system where a
language model is unambiguously the right tool. Everything else it might do,
deterministic code does better: the rules are arithmetic, the ranking is a
sort, the legality check is a set of predicates. Prose is not.

So this module draws the line in the same place as everywhere else, just with
the halves the other way round. `brief()` gathers the facts — every report
time, station and flight number read from the roster, and an acknowledgement
deadline computed from the crew member's own reachability. `render()` turns
them into a message a controller could send unedited. A model may then rewrite
that message, and the verifier checks it afterwards: it may change the wording,
it may not change a time.

dCortex's answer key for Q36 says the judging is on "completeness, correctness
of times from rosters.json, and clarity — not template wording", which is
exactly this split.
