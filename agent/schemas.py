"""Typed answer objects.

These mirror `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` exactly. The agent builds one of these and
prose is rendered *from* it — never the other way round, because the eval
harness scores the object.

`Option` keeps the answer-key field names verbatim (`action`, `crew_id`,
`legal`, `rules_checked`, `cost_inr`, `delay_hours`, `rank`). Fields may be
added; renaming one silently breaks scoring.
